# PEPON

C++ Object Notation file format/reading/writing library for modern C++(17+)

Pepon lets you save and load your **C++ data** easily

```
#include "peponLib/PeponFile.hpp"

std::vector<int> numbers { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 };
std::deque<unsigned int> units { 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 };
std::list<float> ff { 1.1f, 2.2f, 3.3f };

// All this data can be saved and loaded from Pepon files
pepon::PeponFile pf;
pf.saveFile("./pepon_out.txt");
```

## Configuration:

* Use **#define PEPON_USE_STL_PATH** to specify file path using std::filesystem::path. Otherwise, you must specify file path using std::string_view

* struct **PeponQuotes**: You can enable/disable quotation marks for every value shown by the **print()** functions. And you can set the quotation character you want to use

## File format:

* Comments are optional. Each line starting with '//' (C++), '--' (Lua) or a single '#' (Python style) is detected as a comment and saved, to be attached later to a Group

* Groups. Before declaring variables, you need to create at least one group. Think of it as the sections found in .INI files. Group declaration is written using square brackets. Example:

```
// This is my very first group!
[MyFirstGroup]
```

* Variables: They can be **single values**, for example, just an int or a double. Or they can be **containers**, like a vector of floats. The general format for writing a variable is this:

```
a : int = 1
```
This specifies an __int__ value, named __'a'__, with a value of __1__
Variable name, type and value **MUST** be set, always

String values must be written using opening and closing double quotation marks ('"')

```
b : string = "Hello, this is my first string"
```

Containers template type must be always set. Container values must be specified using curly brackets ('{' and '}' characters)

```
c : list<bool> = { true, false, NOT_TRUE, 1, I_JUST_LIED }
```

You can write container values in multiple lines, but the opening '{' must be specified in the same line where the container is declared

```
c : list<bool> = {
    true,
    false,
    0
}
```

You can also write long strings in multiple lines, but the opening '"' must be written in the same line where the string is declared

```
text : string = "First line ............
                 Second line ...........
                 Third line ............"
```

**Note**: You can't write multiline strings if they are the values of a container. Sorry

## Use examples:

```
// Parse Pepon data from memory
std::vector<std::string> lines =
{
    "// Hello, this is a nice C++ style comment",
    "# And this is a nice Python style comment",
    "[My first group]",
    "a : int = 1",
    "b: string=\"Hello world!\"",
    "   EVIL :   vEctOr  <   inT         >   =   {      1,      2,3}",
    "",
    "d:deque<uint> = { 10, 20,",
    "                  30, 40,",
    "                  50, 60 }",
    "",
    " e : string = \"This is a very,",
    "              very long",
    "              string",
    "\"",
    ""
};

pepon::PeponFile pf;
pf.loadFromMemory(lines);

// Show parsed data to console
pf.print();
```

Open **tests/pepon_test.cpp** for more examples

## Future:

* Add support for more containers? (set, unordered_set, map, unordered_map)
